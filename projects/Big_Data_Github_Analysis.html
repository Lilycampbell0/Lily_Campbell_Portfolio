   <h2> Project Goals: </h2>
    <p> Analyze the content of all public Github repositories overtime to learn about trends in programming.
      This project utilizes techniques in natural language processing, spark, and cloud computing. </p>

<h2> Dataset: </h2>
    <p> All Repositories publicly published on Guthub between 2008-2022</p>
    
<h2> Modeling Approach:</h2>
   <ul> 
     <li> Data Processing: Commit messages and content were cleaned, tokenized, then vecorized for ease of NLP </li>
     <li> Similarity Analysis: I used Minhash with Jaccard similarity (MinHashLSH) to analyze the similarity of commit messages and content</li>
     <li> Analysis of Commits over time: Once commits were determined to be duplicates or relatively unique, I compared uniqueness year over year and by coding language </li>
   </ul>

<h2> Key Findings: </h2>
    <ul> 
<li> Usage of GitHub peaked in 2018 with a steep decline in usage after the 2018 GitHub acquisition by Microsoft </li>
<li> There has been a significant rise in usage of open source and cloud technology since the advent of GitHub </li> 
<li> There is evidence for a decline in frequently repeated commits, with very similar commit messages, showing that AI may be able to assist in reducing the amount of bug fixes necessary in coding projects</li>    
</ul>
