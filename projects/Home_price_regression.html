    <h2> Project Goal: </h2>
    <p> Analyze the impact of the 2020 Pandemic on Brooklyn Home Prices to determine the directional impact on the market.
      This project uses regression techniques to isolate the imapct of Covid, holding all other factors constant. </p>

    <h2> Dataset: </h2>
    <p> Data provided from the City of New York on Brooklyn home purchase price included data from 2016 – 2020 on all real estate purchases</p>

    <h2> Methodology:</h2>
      <p> To isolate the effects of a home in Brooklyn being purchased in Q3 vs. Q4 2020 on purchase price, I first limited analysis to single family homes or single occupant condos (as identified by Building Class, Total Class, and Residential Units). Homes with a reported purchase price of under $10k were excluded from analysis as it is likely their sale was not a part of the general market in Brooklyn, but instead due to inheritance, payment-in-kind, etc. I included variables in the regression to allow the sale of a similar home to be compared across quarters. I controlled for the gross square footage of the home, the year the home was built, and whether the home is a single unit condo or is a single-family home. 

        I grouped the neighborhoods into 10 categories by their median house price to control for the effects of the location of the home. Thus, if a home is in a high value neighborhood, the impact of that neighborhood is controlled for in measuring the difference in price level between Q3 and Q4. The groupings of the Brooklyn neighborhoods are shown below. 

        To determine if there was a significant shift in prices between Q3 2020 and Q4 2020 I utilized a categorical variable that represents the quarter in which a home was purchased for every quarter between Q1 2016 – Q4 2020. By setting the reference level to Q3 2020, the model reports the size of the change in price level between each quarter and Q3 2020. 
</p>

    <h2> Key Findings:</h2>
    <p> Model:
\Biggm Purchase\ Price=\beta_1+\beta_2Gross\ Sqft+\beta_3YearBuilt+\beta_4Quarter
+\beta_{5...14}\mathbb{l}{Neighborhood\ Groups\ 1-10}{+\ \beta}_{15,\ \ 16}\mathbb{l}{Condo/Single\ Family\ Home}
+\beta_{17...26}\left(Gross\ sqft\ast\mathbb{l}{Neighborhood\ Groups1-10}\right)
+\beta_{27,\ 28}(Gross\ sqft\ast\mathbb{l}{Condo/Single\ Family\ Home})

This model explains 70% of the variation in home purchase price from Q1 2016- Q4 2020 (adjusted R^2 value of 0.70). The omnibus F test confirms that the explanatory power of the predictors is unlikely to be found through chance alone with significance at the 0.05 level. The Residual Mean Squared Error of this model is $493K. While this is fairly high to predict the exact sale price of a home, the model still allows us to observe the overall directional trends in the market.
